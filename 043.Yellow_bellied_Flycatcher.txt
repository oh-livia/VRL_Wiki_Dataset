0 The Yellow-bellied Flycatcher is a small insect-eating bird of the tyrant flycatcher family.
0 Adults have brownish-olive upperparts, darker on the wings and tail, with yellowish underparts; they have a white eye ring, white wing bars, a small bill and a short tail.
0 The upper part of the bill is dark; the lower part is orange-pink.
0 Their breeding habitat is wet northern woods, especially spruce bogs, across Canada and the northeastern United States.
0 They make a cup nest in sphagnum moss on or near the ground.
0 These birds migrate to southern Mexico and Central America.
0 Yellow-bellied Flycatchers wait on a perch low or in the middle of a tree and fly out to catch insects in flight, sometimes hovering over foliage.
0 They sometimes eat berries or seeds.
0 The Yellow-bellied Flycatcher's call note is transcribed as chu-wee, ascending in pitch.
0 This is very different from the more common Least Flycatcher's dry "CHE-bek."
