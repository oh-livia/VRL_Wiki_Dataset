0 The Heermann's Gull is a gull resident in the United States, Mexico and extreme southwestern British Columbia.
0 Of the current population of about 150,000 pairs, 90% nest on the island of Isla Rasa off Baja California in the Gulf of California, with smaller colonies as far north as California and as far south as Nayarit.
0 After breeding, birds commonly disperse to central California, and less commonly north as far as British Columbia and south as far as Guatemala.
0 They are usually found near shores or well out to sea, very rarely inland.
1 This species looks distinctly different from other gulls.
1 Adults have a medium gray body, blackish-gray wings and tail with white edges, and a red bill with a black tip.
1 The head is dusky gray in non-breeding plumage and white in breeding plumage.
1 Immatures resemble non-breeding adults but are darker and browner, and the bill is flesh-colored or pink till the second winter.
1 A few birds, no more than 1 in 200, have white primary coverts, which form a showy spot on the upper wing.
1 Calls are described as deep and similar in pattern to other gulls but noticeably different in quality.
0 This species nests colonially on the ground, like many gulls.
0 It lays two or three eggs, grayish buff, to buff with gray and brown markings.
0 Heermann's Gull sometimes pirates prey from other seabirds, particularly Brown Pelicans, with which it often associates.
0 Isla Rasa was declared a sanctuary in 1964, and egg-collecting and disturbance during the breeding season are discouraged.
0 Current threats to this gull include the effects of weather on prey species.
