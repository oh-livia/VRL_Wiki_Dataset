1 The Yellow-breasted Chat is a large songbird, formerly considered the most atypical member of the New World warbler family, though the long-standing suspicion is that it does not actually belong there.
0 Its placement is not definitely resolved.
0 It is the only member of the genus Icteria.
0 Found throughout North America, from southern-plains Canada to central Mexico during the summer, these birds mainly migrate to Mexico and Central America, although some of their number may overwinter in coastal areas.
1 Yellow-breasted Chats are noticeably larger than all other warblers, reaching a length of 7.5in and a wingspan of 9.75in.
1 These birds have olive upperparts with white bellies and yellow throats and breasts; they also have long tails, thick heavy bills, large white eye-rings, and dark legs.
0 The breeding habitats of this species are dense, brushy areas and hedgerows.
0 The nests of these birds are cup-shaped, and are placed in thick shrubs.
0 These birds eat insects and berries, and will forage in dense vegetation, occasionally gripping food with their feet.
0 The song of this bird is an odd, variable mixture of cackles, clucks, whistles and hoots.
0 Their calls are harsh chak's.
0 Unlike most warblers, this species has been known to mimic the calls of other birds.
0 This bird is somewhat secretive, but will usually sing from exposed locations.
0 Yellow-breasted Chats are declining in eastern North America due to habitat loss, which is caused primarily from deforestation and urban development.
0 This species is particularly vulnerable to brood parasitism from Brown-headed Cowbirds that have taken advantage of the fragmentation of Eastern forests to expand their range in the last century.
