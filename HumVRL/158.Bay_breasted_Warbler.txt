0 The Bay-breasted Warbler, Dendroica castanea , is a New World warbler.
0 They breed in northern North America, specifically in Canada, into the Great Lakes region, and into northern New England.
0 These birds are migratory, wintering in northwest South America and southern Central America.
0 They are very rare vagrants to western Europe.
0 This species is closely related to Blackpoll Warbler, but this species has a more southerly breeding range and a more northerly wintering area.
0 The summer male Bay-breasted Warblers are unmistakable.
1 They have grey backs, black faces, and chestnut crowns, flanks and throats.
1 They also boast of bright yellow neck patches, and their underparts are white.
1 They have two white wing bars, as well.
1 Breeding females essentially resemble washed out versions of the male.
1 The females are greyish above and white below, with much weaker head patterns.
1 The females also only have chestnut markings on small flank patches, although tiny tints in their grey crowns have been observed.
1 Non-breeding birds have greenish heads, greenish upperparts and yellowish breasts.
1 The yellow extends to the belly of young birds.
1 The two white wing bars are always present in every stage of life.
0 These birds differ from non-breeding Blackpoll Warblers in the absence of breast streaks.
0 Their breeding habitats are coniferous woodlands.
0 Bay-breasted Warblers nest in conifer, laying 3-5 eggs in a cup-shaped nest.
0 More eggs are laid in Spruce Budworm years.
0 These birds feed on insects, and the numbers of these birds vary with the abundance of the Spruce Budworm.
0 These birds will also feed on berries and nectar in wintertime.
0 Their songs are repetitive high-pitched si si si's.
