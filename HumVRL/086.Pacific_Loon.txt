1 The Pacific Loon or Pacific Diver , is a medium-sized member of the loon, or diver, family.
1 It may be conspecific with Black-throated Diver/Arctic Loon, which it closely resembles.
0 It breeds on deep lakes in the tundra region of Alaska and northern Canada as far east as Baffin Island, and in Russia east of the Lena River.
0 Unlike other loons/divers, this bird may migrate in flocks.
0 It winters at sea, mainly on the Pacific coast, or on large lakes over a much wider range, including China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, USA and Mexico.
0 It has occurred as a vagrant to Greenland, Hong Kong, Great Britain, Spain, and Finland.
1 Breeding adults are like a smaller sleeker version of Great Northern Diver/Common Loon.
1 They measure 58-74cm in length, 110-128cm in wingspan and weigh 1-2.5kg.
1 They have a grey head, black throat, white underparts and chequered black-and-white mantle.
1 Non-breeding plumage is drabber with the chin and foreneck white.
1 Its bill is grey or whitish and dagger-shaped.
1 In all plumages, lack of a white flank patch distinguishes this species from the otherwise very similar Black-throated Diver/Arctic Loon.
