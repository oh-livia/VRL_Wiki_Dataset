1 The eyes are yellow with red rims.
0 This gull takes three years to reach its breeding plumage; its appearance changes with each fall moult.
0 Their breeding habitat is near lakes, rivers or the coast in Canada and the northern United States.
0 They nest colonially on the ground, often on islands.
0 This bird tends to be faithful to its nesting site, if not its mate, from year to year.
0 They are migratory and most move south to the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America, also the Great Lakes.
0 This gull is a regular wanderer to western Europe.
0 In Ireland and Great Britain it is no longer classed as a rarity, with several birds regularly wintering in these countries.
0 These birds forage in flight or pick up objects while swimming, walking or wading.
0 They also steal food from other birds and frequently scavenge.
0 They are omnivorous; their diet may include insects, fish, grain, eggs, earthworms and rodents.
0 These birds are opportunistic and have adapted well to taking food discarded or even left unattended by people.
0 It is regarded as a pest by many beach-goers because of its willingness to steal unguarded food on highly crowded beaches.
0 The gull's natural enemies are rats, foxes, cats, raccoons, coyotes, hawks, eagles, and dogs.
0 In the late 19th century, this bird was hunted for its plumage.
0 Its population has since rebounded and it is probably the most common gull in North America.
0 In some areas, it is displacing less aggressive birds such as the Common Tern.
