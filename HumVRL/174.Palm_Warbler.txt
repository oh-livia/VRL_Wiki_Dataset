0 The Palm Warbler, Dendroica palmarum, is a small songbird of the New World warbler family.
0 The species comprises two distinct subspecies that may merit specific status.
1 "Yellow Palm-Warbler" of the eastern third of the breeding range has brownish-olive upper parts and thoroughly yellow underparts with bold rufous breast and flank streaking.
0 It migrates later in the fall than its western counterpart.
0 "Western Palm-Warbler" inhabits the remaining western two-thirds of the breeding range.
1 It has much less yellow below, with less colorful streaking, and cold grayish-brown upper parts.
0 Palm Warblers breed in open coniferous bogs and edge east of the Continental Divide, across Canada and the northeastern United States.
0 Their nests take the form of an open cup, usually situated on or near the ground in an open area.
0 These birds migrate to the southeastern United States, the Yucat√°n Peninsula, islands of the Caribbean, and eastern Nicaragua south to Panama to winter.
0 Palm Warblers forage on the ground much more than other warblers, sometimes flying to catch insects.
0 These birds mainly eat insects and berries.
0 The song of this bird is a monotonous buzzy, trill.
0 The call is a sharp chek.
0 Kirtland's, Prairie, and Palm Warblers are the only Dendroica species that incessantly bob their tails.
0 Palm Warbler has been recorded as a vagrant to Iceland.
