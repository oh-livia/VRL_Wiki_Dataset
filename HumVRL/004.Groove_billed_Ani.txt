1 The Groove-billed Ani, Crotophaga sulcirostris, is an odd-looking tropical bird in the cuckoo family with a long tail and a large, curved beak.
0 It is a resident species throughout most of its range, from southern Texas and central Mexico through Central America, to northern Colombia and Venezuela, and coastal Ecuador and Peru.
0 It only retreats from the northern limits of its range in Texas and northern Mexico during winter.
1 The Groove-billed Ani is about 34cm long, and weighs 70-90g.
1 It is completely black, with a very long tail almost as long as its body.
1 It has a huge bill with horizontal grooves along the length of the upper mandible.
1 It is very similar to the Smooth-billed Ani, some of which have bills as small as the Groove-billed and with grooves on the basal half.
0 The two species are best distinguished by voice and range.
0 In flight, the ani alternates between quick, choppy flaps and short glides.
0 Like other anis, the Groove-billed is found in open and partly open country, such as pastures, savanna, and orchards.
0 It feeds largely on a mixed diet of insects, seeds, and fruits.
0 The Groove-billed Ani lives in small groups of one to five breeding pairs.
0 They defend a single territory and lay their eggs in one communal nest.
0 All group members incubate the eggs and care for the young.
0 The Groove-billed Ani is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.
