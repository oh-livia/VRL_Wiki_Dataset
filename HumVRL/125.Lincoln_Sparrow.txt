1 The Lincoln's Sparrow, Melospiza lincolnii, is a medium-sized sparrow.
1 Adults have dark-streaked olive-brown upperparts with a light brown breast with fine streaks, a white belly, and a white throat.
1 They have a brown cap with a grey stripe in the middle, olive-brown wings, and a narrow tail.
1 Their face is grey with brown cheeks, a brown line through the eye, and an eye ring.
1 They are somewhat similar in appearance to the Song Sparrow.
0 Their breeding habitat is wet thickets or shrubby bogs across Canada, Alaska, and the northeastern and western United States; this bird is less common in the eastern parts of its range.
0 The nest is a well-concealed shallow open cup on the ground under vegetation.
0 These birds migrate to the southern United States, Mexico, and northern Central America; they are passage migrants over much of the United States, except in the west.
0 They forage on the ground in dense vegetation, mainly eating insects and seeds.
0 They are very secretive.
0 Their song is a musical trill, but this bird is often not seen or heard even where they are common.
0 This bird was named by Audubon after his friend, Thomas Lincoln, of Dennysville, Maine.
0 Lincoln shot the bird on a trip with Audubon to Nova Scotia in 1834, and Audubon named it "Tom's Finch" in his honor.
