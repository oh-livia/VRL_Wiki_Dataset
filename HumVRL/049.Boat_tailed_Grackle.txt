0 The Boat-tailed Grackle is a passerine bird of the family Icteridae found as a permanent resident on the coasts of the southeastern USA.
0 It is found in coastal saltwater marshes, and, in Florida, also on inland waters.
0 The nest is a well-concealed cup in trees or shrubs near water; three to five eggs are laid.
1 The male Boat-tailed Grackle is 42cm long.
1 Adult males have entirely iridescent black plumage, a long dark bill, a pale yellowish or brown iris and a long keel-shaped tail.
1 The 37cm long adult female is shorter tailed and tawny-brown in colour apart from the darker wings and tail.
1 Young males are black but lack the adult's iridescence.
1 Immature females are duller versions of the adult female and have blotches or spots on the breast.
1 The eye color of the Boat-tailed Grackle varies with range.
1 Gulf Coast and inland birds have dark eyes, where as Atlantic birds have pale eyes.
0 The Boat-tailed Grackle was first described by French naturalist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1819.
0 Its specific epithet major means "larger" in Latin.
0 Despite its restricted range, there are four subspecies of the Boat-tailed Grackle, differing in size and iris colour.
0 The Boat-tailed Grackle was once considered the same species as the Great-tailed Grackle.
1 The Great-tailed species is of slightly smaller body size, but has a longer tail and lacks this species' distinct domed head shape.
0 These birds forage on the ground, in shallow water, or in shrubs; they will steal food from other birds.
0 They are omnivorous, eating insects, minnows, frogs, eggs, berries, seeds, and grain, even small birds.
0 Boat-tailed Grackles have established significant populations in several United States Gulf Coast cities and towns where they can be found foraging in trash bins, dumpsters, and parking lots.
0 This bird's song is a harsh jeeb, and it has a variety of typically grackle-like chatters and squeaks.
