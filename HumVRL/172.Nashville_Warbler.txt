1 The Nashville Warbler, Oreothlypis ruficapilla, is a small songbird in the New World warbler family.
1 They have olive-brown upperparts, a white belly and a yellow throat and breast; they have a white eye ring, no wing bars and a thin pointed bill.
1 Adult males have a grey head with a rusty crown patch ; females and immature birds have a duller olive-grey head.
0 The Nashville Warbler is closely related to Virginia's Warbler, Lucy's Warbler and Colima Warbler, the four sharing generally similar plumage.
0 Two discrete populations exist.
0 The nominate subspecies, O. r. ruficapilla, breeds in northeastern North America.
0 The other, O. r. ridgwayi, known as Calaveras Warbler, nests in western North America.
1 The latter differs from the former in its relatively duller plumage and more persistent tail movements.
0 Nashville warblers breed in open mixed woods and bog habitats in Canada and the northeastern and western United States of America.
0 They conceal their open cup-shaped nests on the ground under shrubs.
0 They migrate to southernmost Texas, Mexico and Central America in winter.
0 They forage in the lower parts of trees and shrubs, frequently flicking their tails; these birds mainly eat insects.
0 The song of the nominate subspecies consists of a rapid seewit-seewit-seewit-ti-ti-ti.
0 Males sing from open perches on the nesting territory.
0 The call sounds like a high seet.
0 Western birds of the race ridgwayi have a slightly lower-pitched, richer song, and a sharper call note.
0 Although named after Nashville, Tennessee, the Nashville Warbler only visits that area during migration.
