1 The American Three-toed woodpecker, Picoides dorsalis is a medium-sized woodpecker .
1 This woodpecker has a length of 21 cm and a wingspan of 38 cm and closely resembles the Black-backed Woodpecker, which is also three-toed.

0 The breeding habitat is coniferous forests across western Canada, Alaska and the midwestern United States.
0 The female lays 3 to 7 but most often 4 eggs in a nest cavity in a dead conifer or sometimes a live tree or pole.
0 The pair excavates a new nest each year.
0 This bird is normally a permanent resident, but northern birds may move south and birds at high elevations may move to lower levels in winter.
0 Three-toed Woodpeckers forage on conifers in search of wood-boring beetle larvae or other insects.
0 They may also eat fruit and tree sap.
0 These birds often move into areas with large numbers of insect-infested trees, often following a forest fire or flooding.
