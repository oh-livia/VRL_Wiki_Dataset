0 The Cardinals or Cardinalidae are a family of passerine birds found in North and South America.
0 The South American cardinals in the genus Paroaria are placed in another family, the Thraupidae .
0 These are robust, seed-eating birds with strong bills.
1 The family ranges in size from the 12-cm , 11.5-gram Orange-breasted Bunting to the 25-cm , 85-gram Black-headed Saltator.
0 They are typically associated with open woodland.
1 The sexes usually have distinctive appearances; the family is named for the red plumage of males of the type species, the Northern Cardinal.
0 The "buntings" in this family are sometimes generically known as "tropical buntings" or "North American buntings" to distinguish them from the true buntings.
0 Likewise the grosbeaks in this family are sometimes called "cardinal-grosbeaks" to distinguish them from other grosbeaks.
0 The name "cardinal-grosbeak" can also apply to this family as a whole.
