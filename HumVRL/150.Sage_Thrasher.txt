1 The Sage Thrasher is a medium-sized passerine bird from the family Mimidae, which also includes mockingbirds, tremblers and New World catbirds.
0 It is the only member of the genus Oreoscoptes.
0 This seems less close to the Caribbean thrashers, but rather to the mockingbirds instead .
1 O. montanus are pale grey-brown on the upperparts and white on the underparts with dark streaks.
1 They have a slim straight relatively short bill, yellow eyes and a long tail, although not as long as that of other thrashers.
0 As its name suggests, this bird breeds in western North America, from southern Canada to northern Arizona and New Mexico.
0 Its breeding habitat is in areas with dense stands of sagebrush and rarely in other shrubby areas.
0 The female lays 4 or 5 eggs in a twiggy cup nest built in a low bush.
0 Both parents incubate and feed the young birds.
0 In winter, these birds migrate to the southernmost United States and Mexico, including the Baja Peninsula, north and south.
0 They mainly eat insects in summer; they also eat berries, especially in winter.
0 They usually search for insects on the ground in brushy locations.
0 The male bird sings a series of warbled notes to defend his nesting territory.
0 These birds have declined in some areas where sagebrush has been removed but are still common where suitable habitat remains.
0 The continued decline of sagebrush habitats in western North America is cause for alarm for this and other sagebrush dependent species.
