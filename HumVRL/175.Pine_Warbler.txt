0 Their calls are slurred chips.
0 Their breeding habitats are open pine woods in eastern North America.
0 These birds are permanent residents in southern Florida.
0 Some of them, however, migrate to northeastern Mexico and islands in the Caribbean.
0 The first record for South America was a vagrant wintering female seen at Vista Nieve, Colombia, on 20 November 2002; this bird was foraging as part of a mixed-species feeding flock that also included wintering Blackburnian and Tennessee Warblers.
0 They forage slowly on tree trunks and branches by poking their bill into pine cones.
0 These birds also find food by searching for it on the ground.
0 These birds mainly eat insects, seeds and berries.
0 Their nests are deep, open cups, which are placed near the end of a tree branch.
0 Pine Warblers prefer to nest in pine trees, hence their names.
