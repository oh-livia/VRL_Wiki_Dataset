1 The Nelson's Sparrow is a small sparrow.
1 Adults have brownish upperparts with grey on the crown and nape, a cream-coloured breast with light or indistinct streaking and a white throat and belly; they have an orange face with grey cheeks and a short pointed tail.
0 Their breeding habitat is marshes on the Atlantic coast of Canada and Maine, central Canada, , and the north central United States.
0 The nest is an open cup attached to vegetation and close to the ground.
0 Males compete for females but do not defend territories; they sometimes help feed the young.
0 Mating is largely promiscuous by both sexes; multiple paternity in a nest is common.
0 These birds migrate to the southeastern coasts of the United States.
0 They forage on the ground or in marsh vegetation, sometimes probing in mud and eat mainly insects, aquatic invertebrates and seeds.
0 Their call is a raspy trill, almost a mechanical sound.
0 It may be given in flight during the nesting season.
0 The sound has been likened to a drop of water hitting a hot fry pan.
0 This bird was named after Edward William Nelson, an American naturalist.
0 Formerly, this bird and the Saltmarsh Sparrow were considered to be a single species, the Sharp-tailed Sparrow; because of this it was briefly known as Nelson's Sharp-tailed Sparrow.
