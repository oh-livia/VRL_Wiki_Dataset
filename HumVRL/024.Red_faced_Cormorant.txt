0 The Red-faced Cormorant, Red-faced Shag or Violet Shag, Phalacrocorax urile, is a species of cormorant that is found in the far north of the Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, from the eastern tip of Hokkaid≈ç in Japan, via the Kuril Islands, the southern tip of the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands to the Alaska Peninsula and Gulf of Alaska.
0 The Red-faced Cormorant is closely related to the Pelagic Cormorant P. pelagicus, which has a similar range, and like the Pelagic Cormorant is placed by some authors in a genus Leucocarbo.
0 Where it nests alongside the Pelagic Cormorant, the Red-faced Cormorant generally breeds the more successfully of the two species, and it is currently increasing in numbers, at least in the easterly parts of its range.
0 It is however listed as being of conservation concern, partly because relatively little is so far known about it.
1 The adult bird has glossy plumage that is a deep greenish blue in colour, becoming purplish or bronze on the back and sides.
1 In breeding condition it has a double crest, and white plumes on the flanks, neck and rump, and the bare facial skin of the lores and around the eyes is a bright orange or red, giving the bird its name; although the coloration is less vivid outside the breeding season, the red facial skin is enough to distinguish it from the otherwise rather similar Pelagic Cormorant.
1 Its legs and feet are brownish black.
1 Its wings ranges from 25 to 29 cm in extent, with females having on average about 5 cm shorter wings.
1 Adults weigh between 1.5 and 2.3 kg, with females averaging 350g less than males.
0 Analysis of stomach contents suggests that the Red-faced Cormorant is mainly a bottom feeder, taking cottids especially.
0 Adults have few predators, though river otters may attempt to take them, as will corvids of various species, Bald Eagles and Golden Eagles.
0 Gulls and corvids are common predators on eggs and chicks.
