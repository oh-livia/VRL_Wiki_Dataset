1 The Vermilion Flycatcher is a small passerine bird in the Tyrannidae, or tyrant flycatcher family.
1 Most flycatchers are rather drab, but the Vermilion Flycatcher is a striking exception.
1 It is a favourite with birders, but is not generally kept in aviculture, as the males tend to lose their bright red colouration when in captivity.
0 Vermilion Flycatchers generally prefer somewhat open areas, and are found in trees or shrubs in savannah, scrub, agricultural areas, riparian woodlands, and desert as well, but usually near water.
0 Their range includes almost all of Mexico; it extends north into the southwestern United States, and south to scattered portions of Central America, parts of northwestern and central South America, and on southwards to central Argentina.
0 They are also found in the Galapagos Islands.
0 The form inhabiting the Galapagos is sometimes split as Pyrocephalus nanus, Darwin's Flycatcher or the Galapagos Flycatcher.
1 The species grows to about seven inches in length, and is strongly dimorphic; males are bright red, with dark brown plumage.
1 Females have a peach-coloured belly with a dark grey upperside, and are similar to Say's Phoebe.
0 The flycatchers feed mostly on insects such as flies, grasshoppers and beetles.
0 These are usually taken in mid-air, after a short sally flight from a perch.
0 They lay 2-3 whitish eggs in a nest made of twigs, stems and roots, and lined with hair.
0 The eggs are incubated for around two weeks by the female and the young are ready to leave the nest after 15 days of hatching.
