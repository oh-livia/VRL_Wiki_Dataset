0 The Forster's Tern, Sterna forsteri, is a member of the tern family Sternidae.
0 It breeds inland in North America and winters south to the Caribbean and northern South America.
0 This species is rare but annual in western Europe, and has wintered in Ireland and Great Britain on a number of occasions.
0 No European tern winters so far north.
0 This species breeds in colonies in marshes.
0 It nests in a ground scrape and lays three or more eggs.
0 Like all white terns, it is fiercely defensive of its nest and young.
0 The Forster's Tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, but will also hawk for insects in its breeding marshes.
0 It usually feeds from saline environments in winter, like most Sterna terns.
0 It usually dives directly, and not from the "stepped-hover" favoured by the Arctic Tern.
0 The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.
1 This is a small tern, 3336 cm long with a 6470 cm wingspan.
0 It is most similar to the Common Tern.
1 It has pale grey upperparts and white underparts.
1 Its legs are red and its bill is red, tipped with black.
1 In winter, the forehead becomes white and a characteristic black eyemask remains.
0 Juvenile Forster's Terns are similar to the winter adult.
0 The call is a harsh noise like a Black-headed Gull.
1 This species is unlikely to be confused with the Common Tern in winter because of the black eyemask, but is much more similar in breeding plumage.
1 Forster's has a grey centre to its white tail, and the upperwings are pure white, without the darker primary wedge of Common.
0 This bird is named after the naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster.
