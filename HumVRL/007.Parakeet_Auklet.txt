1 The Parakeet Auklet is a small seabird of the North Pacific.
0 It used to be placed on its own in the genus Cyclorrhynchus but recent morphological and genetic evidence suggest it should be placed in the genus Aethia.
0 It is associated with the boreal waters of Alaska and Kamchatka and Siberia.
0 It breeds on the cliffs, slopes and boulder fields of offshore islands, generally moving south during the winter.
1 The Parakeet Auklet is a small auk with a short orange bill that is upturned to give the bird its curious fixed expression.
