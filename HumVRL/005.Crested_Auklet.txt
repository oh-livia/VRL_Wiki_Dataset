1 The Crested Auklet is a small seabird of the family Alcidae which nests in huge colonies in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk.
0 They often breed in mixed-species colonies with Least Auklets, their smaller congener.
0 The Crested Auklet can measure 18-27cm in length, 34-50cm in wingspan and weigh 195-330g.
0 It is recognized primarily by two characters in the breeding season.
1 The first is its 'crest', a group of bristle feathers located above its eye on the top of its head.
0 The second is a social odor that the auklets produce during the breeding season, which has been described as smelling like tangerines.
0 Crested Auklets are planktivores.
0 Their diet consists mainly of krill, but they are also known to eat copepods, pteropods , amphipods and larval fishes.
0 Their main predators are Herring Gulls and other gulls, Arctic Fox and ravens, but they have been reported in the stomachs of halibut caught on St. Lawrence Island.
