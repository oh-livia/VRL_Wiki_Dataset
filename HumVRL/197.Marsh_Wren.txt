1 The Marsh Wren is a small North American songbird of the wren family.
0 It is sometimes called Long-billed Marsh Wren to distinguish it from the Sedge Wren, also known as Short-billed Marsh Wren.
1 Adults have brown upperparts with a light brown belly and flanks and a white throat and breast.
1 The back is black with white stripes.
1 They have a dark cap with a white line over the eyes and a short thin bill.
0 The male's song is a loud gurgle used to declare ownership of territory; western males have a more varied repertoire.
0 Their breeding habitat is marshes with tall vegetation such as cattails across North America.
0 In the western United States, some birds are permanent residents.
0 Other birds migrate to marshes and salt marshes in the southern United States and Mexico.
0 These birds forage actively in vegetation, sometimes flying up to catch insects in flight.
0 They mainly eat insects, also spiders and snails.
0 The nest is an oval lump attached to marsh vegetation, entered from the side.
0 The clutch is normally 4–6 eggs, though the number can range from 3–10.
0 The male builds many unused nests in his territory; he may puncture the eggs of other birds nesting nearby.
0 This bird is still common, although its numbers have declined with the loss of suitable wetland habitat.
0 Wholesale draining of marshes will lead to local extinction.
0 Still, this species is widespread enough not to qualify as threatened according to the IUCN.
