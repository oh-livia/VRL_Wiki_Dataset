0 The Pigeon Guillemot is a medium-sized alcid endemic to the Pacific.
0 They closely resemble the other members of the genus Cepphus, particularly the Black Guillemot, which is slightly smaller.
1 Adult birds have black bodies with a white wing patch broken by a black wedge, a thin dark bill and red legs and feet.
1 They are similar in appearance to the Black Guillemot but show dark wing linings in flight.
1 In winter, the upper parts are mottled grey and black and the underparts are white.
1 They walk well and habitually have an upright posture.
0 Their breeding habitat is rocky shores, cliffs and islands on northern often forming small loose colonies.
0 They usually lay their eggs in rocky cavities near water, but will often nest in any available cavity including caves, disused burrows of other seabirds and even old bomb casings.
0 Unlike many alcids, Pigeon Guillemots are diurnal and lay two eggs.
0 Because they can feed their chicks constantly throughout the day, the chicks fledge faster than equivalent sized auks that are only provisioned at night.
0 Pigeon Guillemots range across the Northern Pacific from the Kuril Islands and the Kamchatka Peninsula in Siberia to coasts in western North America from Alaska to California.
0 After the breeding season birds in Alaska migrate south to open waters, whereas some birds from California move north to the waters off British Columbia.
0 Birds usually return to their natal colony to breed.
0 They dive for food from the surface, swimming underwater, feeding on benthic prey, which is usually obtained close to shore.
0 They mainly eat fish and other aquatic animals, particularly sculpins, sandfish , cods, capelin, and crabs.
0 Chick diet varies slightly, with more fish than invertebrates, particularly rockfish.
