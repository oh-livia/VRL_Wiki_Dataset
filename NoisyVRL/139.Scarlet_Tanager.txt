0 The Scarlet Tanager is a medium-sized American songbird.
0 Formerly placed in the tanager family , it and other members of its genus are now classified in the cardinal family .
0 The species's plumage and vocalizations are similar to other members of the cardinal family.
1 Adults have pale stout smooth bills.
1 Adult males are bright red with black wings and tail; females are yellowish on the underparts and olive on top, with olive-brown wings and tail.
1 The adult male's winter plumage is similar to the female's, but the wings and tail remain darker.
1 Young males briefly show a more complex variegated plumage intermediate between adult males and females.
1 It apparently was such a specimen that was first scientifically described.
1 Hence the older though somewhat confusing specific epithet olivacea is used rather than erythromelas , as had been common throughout the 19th century.
0 Their breeding habitat is large forested areas, especially with oaks, across eastern North America.
0 Scarlet Tanagers migrate to northwestern South America, passing through Central America around April, and again around October.
0 They begin arriving on the breeding grounds in numbers by about May and already start to move south again in mid-summer; by early October they are all on their way south.
0 The bird is an extremely rare vagrant to western Europe.
0 Scarlet Tanagers are often out of sight, foraging high in trees, sometimes flying out to catch insects in flight.
0 They eat mainly insects and fruit.
0 These birds do best in the forest interior, where they are less exposed to predators and brood parasitism by the Brown-headed Cowbird.
0 Their nests are typically built on horizontal tree branches.
0 Specifically their numbers are declining in some areas due to habitat fragmentation, but on a global scale tanagers are a plentiful species.
