0 The Cactus Wren is a species of wren that is native to the southwestern United States southwards to central Mexico.
0 The cactus wren is the largest North American wren, at 18â€“23 cm long.
0 Unlike the smaller wrens, the cactus wren is easily seen.
0 It has the loud voice characteristic of wrens.
0 The cactus wren is much less shy than most of the family.
0 Its marked white eyestripe, brown head, barred wings and tail, and spotted tail feathers make it easy to identify.
0 Like most birds in its genus, it has a slightly curved bill.
0 There is little sexual dimorphism.
0 The Cactus Wren primarily eats insects, including ants, beetles, grasshoppers, and wasps.
0 Occasionally, it will take seeds, fruits, small reptiles and frogs.
0 Foraging begins late in the morning and is versatile; the cactus wren will search under leaves and ground litter and overturn objects in search of insects, as well as feeding in the foliage and branches of larger vegetation.
0 Increasing temperatures cause a shift in foraging behavior to shady and cooler microclimates, and activity slows during hot afternoon temperatures.
0 Almost all water is obtained from food, and free-standing water is rarely used even when found .
0 It is a bird of arid regions, and is often found around yucca, mesquite or saguaro; it nests in cactus plants, sometimes in a hole in a saguaro, sometimes where its nest will be protected by the prickly cactus spines of a cholla or leaves of a yucca.
0 The Cactus Wren forms permanent pair bonds, and the pairs defend a territory where they live all through the year.
