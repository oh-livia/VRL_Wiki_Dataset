0 The Summer Tanager, Piranga rubra, is a medium-sized American songbird.
0 Formerly placed in the tanager family , it and other members of its genus are now classified in the cardinal family .
0 The species's plumage and vocalizations are similar to other members of the cardinal family.
0 Their breeding habitat is open wooded areas, especially with oaks, across the southern United States, extending as far north as Iowa.
0 These birds migrate to Mexico, Central America and northern South America.
0 This tanager is an extremely rare vagrant to western Europe.
0 Adults have stout pointed bills.
0 Adult males are rose red and similar in appearance to the Hepatic Tanager, although the latter has a dark bill; females are orangish on the underparts and olive on top, with olive-brown wings and tail.
0 These birds are often out of sight, foraging high in trees, sometimes flying out to catch insects in flight.
0 They mainly eat insects, especially bees and wasps, and berries.
0 Fruit of Cymbopetalum mayanum are an especially well-liked food in their winter quarters, and birds will forage in human-altered habitat.
0 Consequently, these trees can be planted to entice them to residential areas, and they may well be attracted to bird feeders.
0 Summer Tanagers build a cup nest on a horizontal tree branch.
0 The Summer Tanager has an American Robin-like song, similar enough that novices sometimes mistake this bird for that species.
0 The song consists of melodic units, repeated in a constant stream.
0 The Summer Tanager's song, however, is much more monotonous than that of T. migratorius, often consisting of as few as 3 or 4 distinct units.
0 It is clearer and less nasal than the song of the Scarlet Tanager.
0 The Summer Tanager also has a sharp, agitated-sounded call pi-tuk or pik-i-tuk-i-tuk.
