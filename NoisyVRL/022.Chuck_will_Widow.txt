0 The Chuck-will's-widow, Caprimulgus carolinensis is a nocturnal bird of the nightjar family Caprimulgidae.
0 It is found in the southeastern United States near swamps, rocky uplands, and pine woods.
0 It migrates to the West Indies, Central America, and northwestern South America.
0 This bird is sometimes confused with the Whip-poor-will , due to the peculiar and somewhat similar names.
0 Though rather closely related, they are two distinct species.
0 A fairly generic nightjar, it has mottled brownish underparts, a buff throat, reddish-brown feathers lined with black, and brown and white patterning on head and chest, differing from the gray and black of its more common cousin.
0 Males have patches of white on their outer tail feathers.
0 Its size ranges from 11 to 13 inches long with a 25 inch wingspan, large for a nightjar and like all of them with a short bill and long tail.
0 Its common name derives from its continuous, repetitive song that is often heard at night.
0 This consist of a series of calls with a vibrating middle note between two shorter notes, not much shifting in pitch.
0 It is slower, lower-pitched and less piercing than the song of the Whip-poor-will.
0 "Chuckwuts-widow" is another common name less often found, but also imitating the rhythm of the bird's calls.
0 It eats primarily insects, particular those active at night such as moths, beetles, and winged ants.
0 It will also eat small birds, swallowing them whole.
0 Females do not build nests, but rather lay eggs on patches of dead leaves on the ground.
0 The eggs, which are pink with spots of brown and lavender, are subsequently incubated by the female.
