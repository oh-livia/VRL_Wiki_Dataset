0 The Horned Grebe or Slavonian Grebe, Podiceps auritus, is a member of the grebe family of water birds.
0 The Slavonian Grebe is an excellent swimmer and diver, and pursues its fish prey underwater.
0 The Slavonian Grebe is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies.
1 The Horned Grebe is a small grebe at 31–38cm long with a 46–55cm wingspan.
1 Unmistakable in summer, the plumage of both male and female includes a black head with brown puffy earlike tufts along the sides of its face.
1 It shows a deep red neck, scarlet eyes, and a small, straight black bill tipped with white.
1 It rides high in the water.
0 Slavonian Grebes breed in vegetated areas of freshwater lakes across Europe and Asia.
0 It also breeds in remote inland parts of the United States and much of Canada.
0 Most birds migrate in winter to the coast.
0 During this time, this small grebe is mainly white with a sharply defined black cap.
0 During breeding, the male's call is heard as an odd, striking series of loud croaks and chattering notes followed by prolonged shrieks.
0 Like all grebes, it builds a nest on the water's edge, since its legs are set very far back and it cannot walk well.
0 Usually two eggs are laid, and the striped young are sometimes carried on the adult's back.
0 Folk names of this bird include Devil-diver, hell-diver, pink-eyed diver, and water witch.
0 Its name is often abbreviated by British birders to "Slav Grebe" or simply "Slav".
0 In the lore of the Blackfeet, the trickster Old Man tricked several ducks into closing their eyes and dancing while he killed them one by one.
0 However, the smallest duck looked, saw Old Man, and alerted the other ducks.
0 This "duck" was the Horned Grebe, who became the first to notice trouble.
