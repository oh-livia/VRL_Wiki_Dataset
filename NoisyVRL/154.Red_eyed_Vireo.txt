0 The Red-eyed Vireo, Vireo olivaceus, is a small American songbird, 13â€“14 cm in length.
0 It is somewhat warbler-like but not closely related to the New World warblers .
0 Common across its vast range, this species is not considered threatened by the IUCN.
1 Adults are mainly olive-green on the upperparts with white underparts; they have a red iris and a grey crown edged with black.
1 There is a dark blackish line through the eyes and a wide white stripe just above that line.
1 They have thick blue-grey legs and a stout bill.
1 They are yellowish on the flanks and undertail coverts .
0 This bird, not always seen, may sing for long periods of time; it appears to be endlessly repeating the same question and answer.
0 It holds the record for most songs given in a single day among bird species.
0 More than 20,000 songs in one day.
0 The subspecies breeding in South America have a simpler song, a chestnut iris, and different remiges proportions.
0 They are sometimes split as the Chivi Vireo, V. chivi.
0 Some of the races concerned are V. o. chivi, V. o. vividior, and V. o. tobagoensis, the last being a relatively large subspecies endemic to Tobago.
0 Even within the Chivi Vireo, there are distinct variations in measurements, song and ecology, but the possible taxonomic significance of this remains unclear.
0 In the past, the Yellow-green Vireo and the Noronha Vireo have been considered as subspecies of the Red-eyed Vireo.
