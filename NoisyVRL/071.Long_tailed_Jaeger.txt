0 The Long-tailed Jaeger, Stercorarius longicaudus is a seabird in the skua family Stercorariidae.
1 This is the smallest of the skua family at 3858 cm , depending on season and age.
1 However, much of this, up to 29 cm , is comprised by the tail which may include the 15 cm tail streamers of the summer adult.
1 The wingspan of this species ranges from 102 to 117 cm and the body mass is 230444 g .
1 This species breeds in the high Arctic of Eurasia and North America, with major populations in Russia, Alaska and Canada and smaller populations around the rest of the Arctic.
0 It is a migrant, wintering in the south Atlantic and Pacific.
0 Passage juvenile birds sometimes hunt small prey in ploughed fields or golf-courses, and are typically quite fearless of humans.
0 They nest on dry tundra or higher fells laying two spotted olive-brown eggs.
0 On the breeding grounds they can be heard making yelping and rattling sounds.
0 Outside of the breeding season they spend most of their time over open ocean and have a harsh kreeah cry.
0 This bird feeds on fish , small birds, scraps, small mammals and carrion.
0 On migration, Long-tailed Jaegers are more likely to catch their own food, and less likely to steal from gulls and terns than larger species.
0 This species is unmistakable as an adult, with grey back, dark primary wing feathers without a white "flash", black cap and very long tail.
0 Adults often hover over their breeding territories.
0 Juveniles are much more problematic, and are difficult to separate from Parasitic Jaeger over the sea.
0 They are slimmer, longer-winged and more tern-like than that species, but show the same wide range of plumage variation.
0 However, they are usually colder toned than Arctic, with greyer shades, rather than brown.
