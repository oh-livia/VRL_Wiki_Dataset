0 This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights.
0 They also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe.
0 It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.
