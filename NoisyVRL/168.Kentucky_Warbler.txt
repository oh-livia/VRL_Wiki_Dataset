0 The Kentucky Warbler, Oporornis formosus, is a small species of New World warbler.
0 The Kentucky Warbler, like all members of the genus Oporornis, is a sluggish and heavy warbler with a short tail, preferring to spend most of its time on or near the ground, except when singing.
1 Adult Kentucky Warblers are about 13 cm long.
1 They are mostly an olive-green in color on their back and nape, and a brilliant yellow below from their throat to their belly.
1 They have a small tinge of black on their crown, and a large black mask with a yellow pattern that runs from the beak and encircles the eyes, resembling a pair of spectacles.
1 Female Kentucky warblers have slightly less black on the sides of their head, and immature birds may have almost no black at all.
0 The Kentucky Warbler is a very common bird with a large range, frequenting moist deciduous forests.
0 It is migratory, spending summer in the central and eastern United States, often ranging as far north as Wisconsin to Pennsylvania.
0 Come fall and winter the Kentucky warbler will migrate back to the Yucat√°n Peninsula and the many islands of the Caribbean, flying non-stop across the Gulf of Mexico.
0 Kentucky Warblers nest on the ground hidden at the base of a shrub or in a patch of weeds in an area of ample vegetation.
0 The female will lay between 3 to 6 eggs, which are white or cream-colored and specked with brown.
0 Incubation is done by the female only, and lasts for about 12 days.
0 The young Kentucky Warblers usually leave the nest about 10 days after hatching.
