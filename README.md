Wikipedia articles with labels for 'Detecting Visually Relevant Sentences for Fine-Grained Classification' by Olivia Winn, Madhavan Kavanur Kidambi, and Smaranda Muresan

All documents have each sentence on a separate line, preceeded by the appropriate classification label depending on the label source. A label of 1 means that the sentence contains 'visually relevant' information about the given bird class; a label of 0 means it does not.
'HumVRL' contains all the labels generated by the Amazon Mechanical Turkers
'NoisyVRL' contains all the labels automatically created by classifying all sentences in the 'Description' section of the document as a 1 and 0 otherwise.

The clean_data.py script processes a directory of files, by making the text entirely lowercase, separating all punctuation, and encoding the text in utf-8 format.
