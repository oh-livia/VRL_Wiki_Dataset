0 The Ringed Kingfisher is a large, conspicuous and noisy kingfisher, commonly found along the lower Rio Grande River valley in southeasternmost Texas in the United States through Central America to Tierra del Fuego in South America.
0 The breeding habitat is areas near large bodies of water, usually in heavily wooded areas where it finds a perch to hunt from.
0 It is mostly a sedentary species, remaining in territories all year long.
0 It is 4041 cm long, with deep blue or bluish-gray plumage with white markings, a shaggy crest and a broad white collar around the neck.
0 Its most distinguishing characteristic is the entire rufous belly, which also covers the entire breast of the male.
0 Females are more colorful than the male and have a bluish-gray breast and a narrow white stripe separating the breast from the belly.
0 These birds nest in a horizontal tunnel made in a river bank or sand bank.
0 The female lays 3 to 6 eggs.
0 Both parents excavate the tunnel, incubate the eggs and feed the young.
0 It is often seen perched prominently on trees, posts, or other suitable "watchpoints" close to water before plunging in head first after its fish prey.
0 They also eat small mammals, insects, small reptiles and berries.
0 Their voice is a loud, penetrating rattle given on the wing and when perched.
0 The Megaceryle kingfishers were formerly placed in Ceryle with the Pied Kingfisher, but the latter is genetically closer to the American green
