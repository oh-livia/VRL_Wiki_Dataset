0 A nighthawk is a nocturnal bird of the subfamily Chordeilinae, within the nightjar family, Caprimulgidae.
0 Nighthawks are medium-sized New World birds, with long wings, short legs, and very short bills.
0 They usually nest on the ground.
0 They feed on flying insects.
0 The Least Nighthawk, at and , is the smallest of all Caprimulgiformes.
0 Nightjars are sometimes referred to as goatsuckers from the mistaken belief that they suck milk from goats .
0 Nighthawks have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings.
0 Their soft plumage is cryptically coloured to resemble bark or leaves.
0 Some species perch facing along a branch, rather than across it as birds usually do.
0 This helps to conceal them during the day.
0 The female lays two patterned eggs directly onto bare ground.
0 They are mostly active in the late evening and early morning or at night, and feed on moths and other large flying insects.
0 The bill opens very wide, and has a slightly hooked upper tip.
0 Nighthawks are similar in most respects to the nightjars, but have shorter bills, and plumage that is less soft.
0 Nighthawks are less strictly nocturnal than many nightjars, and may be seen hunting when there is still light in the sky.
0 The flight of the Common Nighthawk is erratic and jerky, as it attempts to prey on various flying insects.
0 Its call is a short, harsh, buzzy sound.
0 The white bands on its underwings are easily seen as it flies in the evening, at an altitude that is often well above the treetops.
0 Also of note is nighthawks' mating ritual.
0 Males will gain considerable altitude, then perform a power dive; as they pull up from the dive, the wings make a sudden, low sound that is called "booming".
