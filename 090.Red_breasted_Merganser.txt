0 The Red-breasted Merganser is a diving duck.
0 The Red-breasted Merganser was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his 18th-century work, Systema Naturae.
1 The adult Red-breasted Merganser is 51–62cm long with a 70–86cm wingspan.
1 It has a spiky crest and long thin red bill with serrated edges.
1 The male has a dark head with a green sheen, a white neck with a rusty breast, a black back, and white underparts.
1 Adult females have a rusty head and a greyish body.
1 The juvenile is like the female, but lacks the white collar and has a smaller white wing patch.
1 The call of the female is a rasping prrak prrak, while the male gives a feeble hiccup-and-sneeze display call.
1 It has been claimed to be the fastest bird in level flight, reaching speeds of 161 km/h , but is disputed whether the White-throated Needletail is faster, reportedly flying at 170 km/h .
0 Red-breasted Mergansers dive and swim underwater.
0 They mainly eat small fish, but also aquatic insects, crustaceans, and frogs.
0 Its breeding habitat is freshwater lakes and rivers across northern North America, Greenland, Europe, and Asia.
0 It nests in sheltered locations on the ground near water.
0 It is migratory and many northern breeders winter in coastal waters further south.
