0 The Lazuli Bunting, Passerina amoena, is a North American songbird named for the gemstone lapis lazuli.
0 The male is easily recognized by its bright blue head and back , its conspicuous white wingbars, and its light rusty breast and white belly.
0 The color pattern may suggest the Eastern and Western Bluebirds, but the smaller size , wingbars, and short and conical bunting bill quickly distinguish it.
0 The female is brown, grayer above and warmer underneath, told from the female Indigo Bunting by two thin and pale wingbars and other plumage details.
0 The song is a high, rapid, strident warble, similar to that of the Indigo Bunting but longer and with less repetition.
0 Lazuli Buntings breed mostly west of the 100th meridian from southern Canada to northern Texas, central New Mexico and Arizona, and southern California.
0 On the Pacific coast their breeding range extends south to extreme northwestern Baja California.
0 They migrate to southeastern Arizona and Mexico.
0 Their habitat is brushy areas and sometimes weedy pastures, generally well-watered, and sometimes in towns.
0 These birds eat mostly seeds and insects.
0 They may feed conspicuously on the ground or in bushes, but singing males are often very elusive in treetops.
0 This bird makes a loose cup nest of grasses and rootlets placed in a bush.
0 It lays three or four pale blue eggs.
0 In the eastern and southern part of its range, it often hybridizes with the Indigo Bunting.
